<p>THE BEST HIKE IN HAWAII… IS IT WORTH HIKING THE STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN? Short answer: yes (as long as you’re not afraid of heights).
    This is probaby one of the most hardest and yet it have the most beautiful view ever.It is exactly 3,922 steps! It will take you anywhere between 2-5 hours to complete.
    Now, just because the hike is legal does not mean that it is easy, and it involved narrow ridges and steep sections that require ropes to haul you up the terrain.
