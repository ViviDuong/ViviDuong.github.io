The hospital I was born in was O’Connor Hospital in Santa Clara. My parents told me that when they rush my mom to labor. They weren’t as prepare as they thought because my mom gave birth to me early. She didn’t have her baby bag all pack so my mom made her sister go to her place and pack her bag. My mom remember like it is yesterday. She remembers the color of her gown to the number on her hospital door.
