My birthday is on April 18th. I was born at 11pm and I am glad my birthday is during this month because I loved the fact that I get to celebrate it during spring break. During this time, the sky is clear, the air is warm, the birds are chirping, and flower are blooming. I usually get all excited once April hits which that means it is almost summer and school will be out in three months.
