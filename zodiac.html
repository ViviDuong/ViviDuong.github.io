I never been a type of person who really got in to zodiac. Since my birthday is on April 18th. My Zodiac sign is Aries. Today ( Tuesday Oct,7th) my strength is courageous, determined, confident, enthusiastic, optimistic, honest, and passionate. While my weakness is impatient, moody, short-tempered, impulsive and aggressive. It said that I enjoyed taking leadership roles, physically challenged and individual sports.
