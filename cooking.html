My favorite thing to cook is Vietnamese food. It is easy and very simple to do and does not require a lot of time in the kitchen. Since I am a college student, I don’t have much time to spend cooking. I need something quick and easy that I can whip up in minutes. Most of Vietnamese food is very simply, clean, and very healthy. So after eating, I don’t feel bad what I just consume.
