As my past time, I do enjoy reading when I have the time. I know everybody have a hard time making an effort do casual reading. We know that is good to put our phone down and turn off the computer. The book Iâ€™ve started reading is Becoming by Michelle Obama even though I only read a few pages I am hooked. I wish I could spend more time reading instead of study and reading for school.
