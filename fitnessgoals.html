After I finished college, I had made a bucket list of all the things I want to complete by a certain age. One of the item on my list, was trying finish 10k, half marathon, and hopefully that will leads me to run a full marathon.  I havenâ€™t started the training because I need to make sure I need focus on how to start my career first. It would be nice to accomplish these goals before I am 30.
