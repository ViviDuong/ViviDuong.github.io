I don’t have a pet because I live with my parent and both of them don’t want wany any in their house. My parents are both clean freak where they can’t stand clean after them. I always wish once I have my own place, I would have a dog. I know that it nice to have a dog so I can it out for a walk and it will bring me so much joy and happiness
