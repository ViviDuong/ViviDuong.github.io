As of right now I am in San Jose. I just recently moved back home because I was going to UCDavis, but since classes are all remotely. I decided to move back home so I can save money for rent and live with my parents. It have been a quite of experience being at home because I miss having the chance to go to the library and study. It was quiet and it help me focused with minimal distraction.
